# PingPlotter by ChatGPT

After being pretty frustrated with my laggy ssh connection from my home internet, I decided I needed a way to better monitor my network latency.

I thought it'd be pretty neat to have a gui to do this.  Rather than taking some time to learn how to do this myself since I'm pretty busy with other things, I figured I'd just ask chatGPT if it could help me out here.

In just a few seconds, I had what I asked for! Amazing!!!

Here's what I asked ChatGPT:

    "can you help me code a small python gui application that will plot ping speeds to track network latency?"

and it gave me the code for 'pingplotter.py' (I added the shebang header only), which I then ran w/o further modification.

Here's what the GUI looks like:



Super helpful!
